<h2>Xgrid Fuse</h2>

<p>Xgrid Fuse version 0.2.0 (Universal binary)</p>

<p>Xgrid FUSE allows to transform an Xgrid controller into a remote volume. Accessing your controller is now just as easy as plugging an external hard drive. This means your job results will appear as actual files in the Finder or in the Terminal, and you can browse your jobs just like real folders and manipulate results just like real files (well, read-only files). All of this goodness thanks to the fantastic MacFUSE project!</p>

<p>Here is the bullet list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Requires Mac OS X 10.4.9</li>
<li>Requires MacFUSE Core 0.2.5 or later</li>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<h3>Installing MacFUSE</h3>

<p>Before using Xgrid FUSE, you must install <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/">MacFUSE</a>. This will install a kernel extension and will require a restart of your machine. The installation itself is very simple and straightforward, but you must be aware that MacFUSE works at a low level in the OS X system, and any bug in there can have serious consequences on the stability of your system. MacFUSE has been remarkably stable for me and for many other people, but it is still at an early stage and should be considered experimental. Do not use on production systems (whatever that means), and use at your own risks. Read more on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/">MacFUSE web site</a>.</p>

<p>Still motivated? Download the latest version from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/">MacFUSE web site</a>, double-click the installation  package and follow the instructions. Then read on.</p>

<h3>Installing Xgrid FUSE</h3>

<p>After downloading the Xgrid FUSE disk image, double-click to open the image, and copy the Xgrid FUSE application into your Applications folder.</p>

<p><img src="readme-copy-to-applications.png" alt="Copying Xgrid FUSE to Applications folder" title="Copying Xgrid FUSE to Applications folder" /></p>

<h3>Runnning Xgrid FUSE</h3>

<p>Double-click on the Xgrid FUSE application icon. A window with a list of local Xgrid controllers should open. To connect to a controller, select it in the list, and click the Connect button (double-arrow icon), or press return. You can also connect to a remote controller by clicking the '+' button and type its address in the sheet that opens. You may be asked for the password to your Xgrid controller.</p>

<p><img src="readme-connect-window.png" alt="Connection window" title="Connection window" /></p>

<p>A new volume should appear on the Desktop (for command-line users, check the <code>/Volumes</code> directory). Inside this volume, you can browse the controller hierarchy, from the grids (usually only one), down to jobs, tasks, and result files. Note that result files will only upload after you select a job. It may take a while to download all the files if your results are large files, or if your connection to the controller is slow.</p>

<p><img src="readme-xgrid-filesystem-hierarchy.png" alt="Xgrid filesystem hierarchy" title="Xgrid filesystem hierarchy" /></p>

<p>Grids and jobs will appear as folder with a name composed of their identifier followed by their actual name (e.g. '-10- My Grid' or '-19289- fasta job'). Tasks will appear as folders, named after their task index. While the results are still loading, the task name will have include the word "loading..." after the task index.</p>

<p><img src="readme-loading-results.png" alt="Loading job results" title="Loading job results" /></p>

<p>Typically, you would then drag the job folders to your local hard drive to get all the results uploaded on your machine. And now, a really cool feature. Just drag the jobs you don't need anymore to the trash and boum, the jobs are deleted from the remote controller! The Finder will ask you confirmation, <code>/bin/rm</code> will not.</p>

<h3>Quitting Xgrid FUSE</h3>

<p>To quit Xgrid FUSE, eject the disk corresponding to the Xgrid controller by dragging it to the trash in the Finder, or using the <code>umount</code> command in the Terminal. A lost connection should have the same effect (with the possibility of an annoying spinning beach ball first).</p>

<h3>Known limitations and bugs</h3>

<ul>
<li>Even though GridEZ normally allows application based on it to remember previously connected servers, Xgrid Fuse will not remember them. This is not a problem for local/Bonjour servers that will always show up anyway, but it will be a problem for remote servers, for which you will have to type the address every time you run Xgrid Fuse. If somebody can solve threading issues described in the source code before I have a chance to do it, that would be great..</li>
<li>There is no apparent way to quit Xgrid FUSE when you change your mind and don't want to initiate any connection. It is in fact very easy: Command-Q works as expected, because the menu is not displayed but is actually listening. Of course, <code>/bin/kill</code> also works.</li>
<li>You cannot open more than one controller at a time.</li>
<li>The memory used by Xgrid FUSE will be as big as the files that you upload for your job results, which might be too big in some cases, and will cause Xgrid FUSE to crash. Watch out!</li>
<li>The Finder will not always display the most recent version of the jobs, tasks and files. Move up and down the hierarchy to force refreshes.</li>
<li>If you upload the results from a job that is not yet finished, it will only upload the partial results, and will not properly update the content later. The only workaround is to eject the Xgrid volume and restart Xgrid FUSE.</li>
</ul>
